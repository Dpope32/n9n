## Why n8n IS the Future

**Open source = extensible**
Complete control and unlimited customization possibilities

**Self-hosted = no vendor lock-in**
Your data, your infrastructure, your rules

**Visual + code = appeals to both crowds**
Drag-and-drop simplicity with code flexibility when needed

**Growing fast AF**
Massive community adoption and enterprise momentum

## Revolutionary Browser Extension Idea

Picture this: You're in n8n, you highlight a section and hit a hotkey, an AI chat slides out and you say:

*"Add a step that takes this webhook data, cleans the email field, and sends it to my CRM if the company size > 50 employees"*

**BAM** - the extension generates the nodes, connects them, configures everything. Cursor for Automation.

## Why Browser Extension Wins

**Instant adoption** - works with ANY n8n instance (cloud, self-hosted)

**Web app reach** - millions of users, easy install

**Revolutionary UX** - AI directly IN the workflow builder

**No n8n dependency** - you're not waiting for them to approve features

## The Vision

You become the AI layer on top of n8n. Every automation builder installs your extension. You're not competing with n8n - you're making it 10x better.
